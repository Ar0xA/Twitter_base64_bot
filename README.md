# Twitter_base64_bot

A basic bot for testing how to use the Twitter API with Python-Twitter.

In this case it's just a simple script that encodes/decodes base64 text that gets tweeted with his name as first mention.

How to use:

Tweet:
@botname [text to encode/decode]

or

@botname [pastebin URL]

known issue: no decode base64 from pastebin yet.
