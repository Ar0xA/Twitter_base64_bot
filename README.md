# Twitter_base64_bot

A basic bot for testing how to use the Twitter API with Python-Twitter.

In this case it's just a simple script that encodes/decodes base64 text that gets tweeted with his name as first mention.

next up: if its a pastebin URL , it will get the content and try the same thing encoding/decoding making a new pastebin, and tweeting you the URL
